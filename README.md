# todo-bomb
Our projects have a lot of todos and nobody cares, how about a bomb?

## UseCase
I want to create a tool or script that let the build fail if there is a TODO longer then a specific amount of time.
  - Additionally a plugin for Intellij and VSCode to warn you about the amount of time for several todos.
